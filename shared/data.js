/*
  Aegis One data layer — THE HANDOFF POINT between the UI and the extension logic.

  The UI never talks to the network itself. It reads one object from
  chrome.storage.local under the key "aegisData", shaped like this:

  {
    sites: [
      {
        domain: "dailynews.example",
        lastVisit: "2026-10-23T14:02:00Z",
        cookieChoice: "declined" | "accepted" | "no-reject" | "none",   // "none" = no banner seen; "no-reject" = banner had no way to say no
        cookies: [ { name, domain, firstParty, category, company, purpose, days } ],  // names only, never values (shared/cookies.js)
        breach: { name, breachDate, addedDate, pwnCount } | null,      // the site's own most recent breach (Have I Been Pwned)
        policy: { sells: true|false|null, shares: true|false|null, source: "url or null" },
        trackers: [
          { domain: "doubleclick.net", company: "Google", category: "Advertising", country: "US" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

  Whoever writes the background script only has to keep that object updated.
  Scores and grades are calculated HERE (computeScore) so every screen agrees.
  If no real data exists yet, the UI shows SAMPLE_DATA with a "sample data" note. With Settings > "Show example
  data" on, load() adds shared/example-data.js's sites (each marked example: true) and returns example: true.
