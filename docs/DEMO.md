# Demo and video plan (v3, 2026-10-25 4:10 PM ET, main 3342c4e; the video opens on the dashboard with example data on)
Video limit: **3 minutes**. Round 1 judges see only the Devpost page, this video and the repo; Monday's finals are live.
Every site and answer below was checked in real Chrome on the ASUS G14 (Windows, Gemma 4 E2B in the browser, main dde8558, Oct 25), and the fixes made after that (main c3036db) were checked with the real Ask C code, and with Gemma 4 E4B (Ollama) on the Mac. Sunday afternoon's Ask C, Clear and cookie pop-up fixes were checked again on the G14 with the real in-browser Gemma (main 7c54ac5 to a5abdc6; reports in the team's project files). Grades on the Mac will differ a little (different visits): rehearse once on the recording computer, and anything that fails twice gets cut.

## Words used here
- **Instant answer**: Ask C answers from Aegis One's own records in code, in about 0.1 s, with no AI. Safest on camera.
- **Gemma answer**: Gemma 4 writes it inside Chrome; words start after about 1-2 s and stream in.
- **Tag**: the [Seen on your visit] / [HIBP] / [Government list] label after a fact, naming its source.

## Before recording (15 minutes)
1. **Update**: GitHub Desktop → Fetch origin → Pull origin (main at ad603c0 or newer). Then chrome://extensions → Aegis One → the **circular reload arrow**.
   - **On the repo owner's Mac**, Pull origin stops with a conflict in shared/askc.js: the Mac's 2 local commits from Oct 24 are already on GitHub under other names. In Terminal, run `cd ~/Documents/GitHub/HackAGator_Privacy_Extension && git pull --rebase origin main` instead. It says "skipped previously applied commit" twice, then "Successfully rebased" (tested on a copy; nothing is lost).
   - **Never click Remove**: Remove deletes C's brain (2 GB). Reload keeps it, as long as Aegis One stays loaded from the same folder.
2. **Settings** (gear, top right of the dashboard): Show the grade box **on**; Protect me automatically **off** (so C asks on camera); every pop-up switch on; Read privacy policies with Gemma **on**.
3. **Brain**: the Ask C tab says "Gemma 4 E2B is running in your browser." Ask one question ("Who is ByteDance?") so the first, slowest load is done before recording.
   - Windows only: Settings > System > Display > Graphics → Chrome → High performance, then restart Chrome (Gemma is several times faster).
4. **Fill the week**: optionally Clear my Aegis One data first, then open each site in the table below for about 20 s, with C's brain ready, so grades, trackers and privacy policies are recorded. Open **nytimes.com** at least once (for the "share my data" answer).
5. **Screen**: window at least 1280×800, zoom 100-110%, other tabs closed, bookmarks bar hidden, Do Not Disturb on, other extensions with pop-ups off (an ID.me coupon pop-up appeared on economist.com).

## Scenes: what to open and what you should see
| Scene | Open | Backup | What you should see (G14, Oct 25) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Good grade | duckduckgo.com | wikipedia.org, youtube.com | A 0 (wikipedia A 10, youtube A 10) and the grade box top right |
| C declines for you | gov.uk | superdrug.com; Settings → "See C on 17 kinds of cookie pop-ups" | C beside the banner → **Protect me** → "Nice! Your optional cookie preferences were saved as declined." Then the grade box (gov.uk A, superdrug B 33) |
| No Reject button | cnn.com | mcdonalds.com/us | C says **Beware!** about 1.7 s after loading and hides by itself about 7 s later. cnn.com C 45. (puffco.com also gets Beware! on the G14 now, but its banner only shows in some regions: the Mac gets none) |
| Foreign-adversary alert + unsafe site | wired.com | weather.com | C's alert names **ByteDance (China)** at about 2.7 s; at about 12 s the warning "Careful: Aegis One grades this site F ... (WIRED, 2025) ... Go back / Continue anyway". F 100. weather.com: Baidu (Pentagon 1260H list), warning at about 18 s, F 85 |
| State-run media | tass.com | | The alert names Yandex (Russia) and TASS (Russia; state-run media). D 70 |
| Popup | Aegis One's toolbar button on wired.com | | F 100 with every point explained, the companies, "Clear wired.com's data", and **Ask C why it got an F** |
| Dashboard | Overview → Sites → C's impact → Safety → Grades | | Every site graded; the "How the grade works" table on Grades |

- Don't open baidu.com or tiktok.com live: some networks block them (both failed on the G14's network). weather.com shows the Baidu link instead.
- U.S. visitors rarely see cookie banners, which is why the cookie scenes use U.K. sites.

## Ask C: questions that work
**Instant answers** (best for the video):
| Ask | You get |
|---|---|
| "Why did wired.com get an F?" (suggestion button, or the popup's "Ask C why") | Score 100, each point with its tag: 88 tracker companies, Baidu on the 1260H list, the WIRED breach (2025), no cookie banner |
| "Is wired.com safe?" | The grade, its foreign-adversary companies, the breach (2.4 million accounts), what to do |
| "Was zara.com hacked?" (suggestion button) | April 2026, 197 thousand accounts, what was exposed, what to do |
| "Did any site I visited get hacked?" | Every visited site in Have I Been Pwned (zara, linkedin, wired, facebook) |
| "Which site tracks me the most?" | weather.com: 156 trackers from 130 companies |
| "Should I trust cnn?" → "why?" → "and espn?" | cnn.com's grade and points; "why?" explains them; "and espn?" gives espn's (follow-ups fixed overnight) |
| "Which sites recorded my screen?" | Each screen-recording company with its address and the site that loaded it, then "None of your other N sites loaded one" (also works for malware, data brokers, fingerprinting) |
| "Can malware steal my passwords?" | Names the malware-labelled tracker and its site (yadro.ru on tass.com on the G14), with steps |
| "Which of my sites had recent data breaches?" | The same list for every wording: breaches reported in the last 12 months first |
| "Are you tracking me?" | "No. I don't track you or record your screen", then what Aegis One does keep |
| "Who is Google and should I worry?" (suggestion button) | Tracker domains and reach, sites it was on, what its trackers could see, no breach on record (fixed overnight; Gemma used to say Google does "data brokering") |
| "Does nytimes share my data?" | "Yes, by its own words." with the sentence from nytimes's own privacy policy, which Gemma read on this computer |
| "Does wired.com sell my data?" | An honest "I don't know yet" (policy not read), the ad companies and California data brokers it loaded, and "it doesn't prove your data was sold" |
| "Is Meta safe?" / "Is you tube safe?" | Owner names and typos work |
| "Are you made with Gemma?" | Gemma 4 (Mar 31, 2026) inside Chrome with LiteRT-LM; nothing leaves the computer |
| "How many data breaches happen without people knowing?" | Worked out from Have I Been Pwned's own list: half were added at least 4 months after the breach, over a third more than a year later (instant since the overnight Mac check) |
| "Does my browsing leave my computer?" | C's privacy promise |
| "Write me a poem" | A polite no: C sticks to privacy |

**Gemma answers** (show at least one; it's the proof for Best Use of Gemma):
| Ask | Why it's good |
|---|---|
| "Is any site I visited connected to China or Russia?" | On the G14 it named wired.com → ByteDance and tass.com → Yandex, with tags; the same on the Mac |
| "Which data brokers have seen me?" (suggestion button) | Names the registered California data brokers seen on your visits ("Collective Roll" is the company Tracker Radar lists for stackadapt.com; the registry lists it as StackAdapt Inc.) |
| "Who is ByteDance?" | China-based, its tracker reach; says it is **not** on the 1260H list (fixed again Sunday afternoon, checked on the G14) |
| "Who is Criteo?" then "Are they a data broker?" | Stays on Criteo: registered in California as "Criteo Corp." (checked on the G14) |
| "What did C do for me this week?" | Uses the C's impact numbers (fixed overnight, checked on the Mac) |

**Don't ask on camera** (known weak spots):
- "Check the ive been pwned list": repeats the previous answer.
- A site you didn't open this week: an honest but flat "I don't know".
- Long chains of follow-ups: C keeps the topic of the last 3 questions, but "why?" and "and <site>?" are the ones checked.

## Resets (to film a scene again)
| To see again | Do this |
|---|---|
| A cookie banner and C's offer | Aegis One popup → "Clear gov.uk's data" (the red button turns "Tap again to clear"; tap again and it turns green "Cleared" with "Removed N cookies...") → reload the page |
| The foreign-adversary alert (once per site per browser session) | Reload Aegis One with the circular arrow (the brain stays), or restart Chrome |
| The unsafe-site warning and the grade box (once per site per day) | chrome://extensions → Aegis One → "service worker" → Console → paste `chrome.storage.local.remove(["aegisUnsafeSeen", "aegisChipSeen"])` → Enter. It keeps the week's history (Clear my Aegis One data would empty the dashboard) |

## 3-minute script
Version 2 of the Drive doc "Aegis One 3-Minute Demo Script" (Hackathon folder) has the full spoken lines and captions. The dashboard comes first (Preston, Oct 25): it starts on Overview with Settings > Your data > "Show example data" on, then shows C on websites in Fink's order. Record each part separately, then join them.
| # | Time | Open | Say and show |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0:00-0:20 | Dashboard Overview ("Example data" badge) | The problem, Aegis One, Gemma 4 inside Chrome. Caption: "Example data: a sample month" |
| 2 | 0:20-0:35 | Overview's "Worth knowing" | Click "ByteDance (China), Baidu (China), Tencent (China) and Yandex (Russia) tracked you on 4 sites": the Sites tab highlights them. Caption: 1260H list (Jun 8, 2026), 15 CFR 7.4 |
| 3 | 0:35-0:55 | Overview, "Cookies your sites kept" | The small C beside _ga (13 of 14 sites) opens "C explains" (Open Cookie Database), then "Continue in Ask C" |
| 4 | 0:55-1:20 | Ask C | Instant: "Which sites recorded my screen?" (Hotjar). Gemma, sped up: "Is any site I visited connected to China or Russia?". Point at the tags. Backups: "Which site tracked me the most?", "Who is Criteo?" |
| 5 | 1:20-1:32 | Sites, flightdeals.example | Grade steps, companies (each with a C button), the privacy-policy line |
| 6 | 1:32-1:44 | Safety, then C's impact, "30 days" | "31 of 195 visits were risky", "C stepped in 117 times" (read your screen) |
| 7 | 1:44-1:54 | Grades | A rule's C button ("Explain this grading rule"): instant. Code sets the grade, never the AI |
| 8 | 1:54-2:04 | About | Gemma 4, LiteRT-LM for the web, the 1260H update, the 2026 California broker registry, RegTrack. Caption: Tracker Radar, HIBP, Open Cookie Database, State Media Monitor |
| 9 | 2:04-2:48 | gymshark.com, tesco.com, mcdonalds.com/us, uniqlo.com | Gymshark: Protect me, "Nice!", grade box. Tesco: C hangs by Reject. McDonald's: Beware!. Uniqlo: C's alert (fill in the company and country), the popup's breach and privacy-policy lines, "Ask C why it got" its grade. Backup for the alert: wired.com |
| 10 | 2:48-3:00 | C waves; repo link, "MIT open source" | "A tracker loading doesn't prove data was sold, and the grade is our own rubric. C has your back." |

- Before recording: open gymshark, tesco and uniqlo once (so their policies are read), then "Clear this site's data" on each so their banners come back.
- uniqlo.com and tesco.com return "Access Denied" to automated test browsers; they work in a normal Chrome (Fink's, Oct 25).
- If it runs long: Tesco becomes a two-second shot; part 6 shows only Safety. Never cut the Ask C buttons, the Gemma answer or the About tab.

## Lines that sell it (real numbers, Oct 25)
- "weather.com loaded 156 trackers from 130 companies in one visit." (G14)
- "Google's trackers were on 14 of the 21 sites I opened this week." (G14)
- "In Have I Been Pwned's own list, half the breaches were added at least 4 months after they happened, and over a third more than a year later. You can't wait for the news." (979 breaches; median 144 days; 350 over a year)
- "RegTrack (2026): accepting all cookies raised tracking from 48.5 to 56.2 tracker domains per site."
- "C says no for you, then checks the site really saved it."

## If something fails live
- Gemma slow or not loading: use the instant answers. Grades, C's pop-ups and the popup never need Gemma.
- No cookie banner: Settings → "See C on 17 kinds of cookie pop-ups".
- A pop-up already shown: see Resets.
- Keep a backup clip of every scene (record them Sunday morning).
