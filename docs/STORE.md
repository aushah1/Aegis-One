# Publishing Aegis One on the Chrome Web Store

Status (written 2026-10-24 on branch `max/store-ready`, now part of main; checked against the code on 2026-10-24): the code meets every Store rule we can check in code (`tests/store-ready.test.js`).
PRIVACY.md and TERMS.md were checked line by line against what the code stores and sends; section 6 lists the code changes we still recommend before a public upload.
What's left is the account, the upload and the forms below; every answer is written out so you can paste it.

## 1. Before you upload (people, not code)
- [ ] **Pick whose account publishes it.** The developer email can't be changed later, so use a team or repo-owner account, not a personal one you might drop.
- [ ] **Register** at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole: accept the developer agreement and pay the one-time registration fee (US$5 when this was written; the sign-up page shows the current amount). Google may ask you to turn on 2-Step Verification for the account.
- [ ] **Contact email.** The Store shows a developer email on the listing and Google must be able to reach it. Use a team address you'll keep (it can't be moved to another account later). PRIVACY.md and TERMS.md point people to GitHub issues, which works without an email.
- [ ] **Privacy policy URL.** The Store needs a public web page, not a file in a zip. Easiest: merge this branch into main and use https://github.com/gormandyp/HackAGator_Privacy_Extension/blob/main/PRIVACY.md (the repo must stay public). Cleaner: turn on GitHub Pages for the repo and use that address. The welcome page already links to the GitHub address.
- [x] **License for the code:** MIT (LICENSE, added 2026-10-24). `shared/atlas.json` comes from Tracker Radar and stays under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
- [ ] **Trader or non-trader:** a free student project with no business behind it is a **non-trader**.
- [ ] **Wait until after the hackathon (Sun 4 PM).** Review can take days to weeks for an extension that runs on every site, and nothing here is needed for judging.
- [ ] **Retake screenshots with real browsing** (optional but better): the ones in `store/` use the dashboard's sample data and show a "Sample data" badge.

## 2. Build the upload
Upload from **main** (the in-browser AI version). The `ollama` branch carries the same PRIVACY.md, TERMS.md and welcome page so its download tells people the same thing, but it needs the separate Ollama app, so it isn't the Store version.
```
node --test                       # everything must pass
node scripts/package-store.js     # makes dist/aegis-<version>.zip (about 8 MB)
```
Upload that zip. It leaves out tests, docs, scripts and any bundled AI model (users download the model in Ask C).
Every later update: raise `"version"` in manifest.json first (for example 0.1.0 → 0.1.1), or the Store refuses the upload.

## 3. Store listing tab
- **Name:** Aegis One (from manifest.json)
- **Summary (from manifest.json, 132 characters max):** See which companies track you on each site, get an A-F privacy grade, and let C decline extra cookies. Its AI runs on your computer.
- **Category:** Privacy & Security (if not offered: Tools)
- **Language:** English
- **Store icon:** icons/icon128.png
- **Screenshots (1280×800):** store/screenshot-1-overview.png, -2-sites, -3-impact, -4-c-on-banner, -5-grades
- **Homepage / support URL:** https://github.com/gormandyp/HackAGator_Privacy_Extension
- **Description:**

> Aegis One shows you who is watching you online, and helps you do something about it.
>
> Every site you visit quietly connects you to other companies: advertisers, data brokers, analytics and session-recording services. Aegis One lists them for each site, explains what each one does, and gives the site a privacy grade from A to F. Every point in the grade is explained, and anything Aegis One couldn't check is marked "not checked yet", never "safe".
>
> MEET C
> C is Aegis One's on-screen helper. When a site shows a cookie banner, C offers to click Reject for you, then checks the site actually saved your choice. C warns you about banners with no Reject button, and about connections to companies on U.S. government lists (the Pentagon's Section 1260H list and the Commerce Department's foreign-adversary list), always naming the list and its date.
>
> ASK C
> Ask questions like "What is this site collecting about me?" or "Who is Criteo?" C answers in seconds with a source on every fact. C's AI, Google's Gemma 4, runs inside Chrome on your own computer (a one-time 2 GB download), so your questions and browsing never leave it.
>
> ALSO
> - Reads privacy policies and tells you whether a site says it sells or shares your data, with the exact quote.
> - Flags sites with data breaches (Have I Been Pwned) and trackers owned by registered data brokers (California).
> - Daily, weekly and monthly views of what C did for you and how safe your browsing was.
> - Light and dark mode, Liquid glass or Clean style, six glass colors.
>
> YOUR DATA STAYS YOURS
> Aegis One keeps site names (never full addresses) and cookie names (never their contents) on your computer for 7 days, and number-only daily totals for 90 days. It downloads whole public lists and matches them locally, so it never reveals what you visit. Nothing is sold or shared, and the Aegis One team never sees your data. One click erases everything.
>
> Aegis One observes what sites connect to; a tracker loading means a company could collect data, not proof it was sold. Built at Gator Hack V (University of Florida, 2026).
>
> Data: DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), Have I Been Pwned (CC BY 4.0), Open Cookie Database (Apache 2.0), California Data Broker Registry. AI: Gemma 4 with LiteRT-LM (Apache 2.0).

## 4. Privacy practices tab (paste these)
**Single purpose:**
> Aegis One shows users which companies track them on the websites they visit, grades each site's privacy, and helps them limit that tracking by declining optional cookies. Every feature (tracker list, grade, cookie help, alerts, and the on-device AI assistant that answers questions about this data) serves that one purpose.

**Permission justifications:**
| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Saves the user's 7-day list of visited site names, the trackers and cookie names seen on them, daily totals and settings, on the user's computer. |
| `unlimitedStorage` | The optional on-device AI model (Gemma 4, about 2 GB) is cached locally after the user clicks "Download C's brain"; it exceeds the default storage quota. |
| `webRequest` | Observes which third-party domains each page contacts so Aegis One can list the tracking companies on that site. Read-only; no requests are blocked or changed. |
| `webNavigation` | Knows when a tab starts a new page so trackers are counted for the right site, and ignores background pre-loads that the user never saw. |
| `cookies` | Lists the names, owners and lifetimes of cookies a site sets so Aegis One can show what it stores in the browser. Cookie values are never read into storage. |
| `alarms` | Refreshes the public breach and data-broker lists once a day. |
| `browsingData` | Only when the user taps "Clear this site's data" twice in Aegis One's pop-up: removes that one site's own cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, cache storage, service workers and cache. Never history, passwords or downloads. |
| `scripting` | When the user clicks the toolbar button on a tab that was open before Aegis One was installed, adds Aegis One's panel to that one tab. |
| `offscreen` | Runs the on-device AI model (Gemma 4 via WebGPU) in a hidden extension page, because a service worker can't use WebGPU. |
| Host permission `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` | Aegis One's purpose is to show who tracks the user on every site they visit, which requires observing requests on all sites, detecting cookie banners in the page so C can offer to decline them, and showing C's alerts on the page. |

**Remote code:** "No, I am not using remote code." All JavaScript and WebAssembly, including Google's LiteRT-LM runtime, is in the package (`vendor/litert-lm/`). The optional download from Hugging Face is model weights (data), pinned to one exact file and checked by size; it contains no code.

**Data usage, what Aegis One collects** (it stays on the device, but the Store counts anything the extension handles):
- [x] **Web history**: names of sites visited (not full URLs), kept 7 days on the device.
- [x] **Website content**: reads cookie-banner buttons, "Privacy" links and a site's privacy-policy text, on the device, to decline cookies and answer policy questions.
- [x] **User activity**: the Store's examples include "network monitoring" and "clicks". Aegis One watches which outside servers each page contacts (`webRequest`, read-only) and records the user's cookie-banner choice. No keystrokes, mouse movement or scrolling. Ticking this matches what the code does; leaving it unticked risks a rejection for under-disclosure.
- [ ] Personally identifiable info, health, financial, authentication, personal communications, location: **not collected**. (A server's country is not the user's location.)

Google's User Data FAQ (question 3) says data that is only processed or stored on the device must still be disclosed, which is why these are ticked even though nothing leaves the computer.

**Certifications:** check all three: no selling or transferring to third parties outside the approved uses; no use or transfer for purposes unrelated to the single purpose; no use for creditworthiness or lending.

**Privacy policy URL:** https://github.com/gormandyp/HackAGator_Privacy_Extension/blob/main/PRIVACY.md (after this branch is merged into main), or a GitHub Pages copy. Terms of use: TERMS.md (the Store has no field for it; it ships in the zip and the welcome page links to it).

## 5. Things a reviewer may question (and our answer)
- **Runs on every site.** Needed for the single purpose; the justification above says why. Expect a longer "in-depth" review.
- **Clicks buttons on websites** (Reject, "Do not sell or share"). Disclosed in the description, the welcome page and PRIVACY.md. The cookie offer and automatic declining have switches in Settings › C on websites; the "Do not sell or share" click has no switch yet (it's in content/cookie-detector.js, Matthew's file). A switch for it would make review smoother.
- **Large WebAssembly file** (LiteRT-LM, 22 MB, Google's Apache 2.0 build, unmodified). It's minified, not obfuscated; its source is public.
- **Tracker Radar license is non-commercial (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).** Aegis One must stay free, with no ads or paid features, and keep the credit.
- **Disclosure on install** (rule enforced since Aug 1, 2026): the welcome page (welcome/welcome.html) opens on first install and says what Aegis One keeps, what it does on websites and what it downloads. If Aegis One ever changes what it records or sends, update PRIVACY.md and the welcome page and tell users in the extension before shipping.

## 6. Code changes we recommend before a public upload (from the 2026-10-24 security audit, re-checked against this branch)
**Status 2026-10-24 (evening):** fixes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are done on every branch, with tests (tests/policy-reader.test.js, tests/tracking.test.js, tests/senders.test.js, tests/cookie-detector.test.js, tests/store-ready.test.js). Fix 5 is still open (Matthew's file).
None of these send browsing data anywhere, and PRIVACY.md describes today's behavior honestly, so they don't block the hackathon. They are what a careful reviewer or a security researcher would point at.
1. **Policy reader follows redirects** (`background/policy-reader.js`, `redirect: "follow"`). A site's own "Privacy" link can forward Aegis One's request to another address, including one on the user's home network. Fix: refuse a final address that isn't on the same site, and never follow to `localhost` or private IP ranges. **Done:** a reply that was forwarded to another site, `localhost` or an IP address is thrown away unread (Chrome has already sent that request, without cookies; Aegis One can't see a forward's address before Chrome follows it).
2. **Policy page is fetched again on every visit while C's AI isn't set up** (a failed read saves nothing, so `checkedAt` never gets set). Fix: check the AI is ready before fetching, or remember a failed try for a day. **Done:** a page that arrived but couldn't be read is kept in memory (not storage) for a day, up to 5 pages.
3. **Old history is only deleted when you next browse** (`isFresh` runs inside `saveSite`). Fix: also prune on Chrome start and on the daily alarm, so "7 days" holds even if Aegis One sits idle. **Done:** `pruneOldSites()` in background/tracking.js runs when the background starts, on Chrome start and on a daily alarm.
4. **Message handlers don't check who is asking** (`background.js` `askC`, `aegis-ai`; `background/tracking.js` `aegis-tab-site`), and `content/cookie-detector.js` writes `aegisData` itself. Only Aegis One's own scripts can reach them (no `externally_connectable`), but one shared sender check, and moving that write into the background, would match the "only the background writes aegisData" rule in CLAUDE.md. **Done:** background/senders.js; Ask C, the streaming port, list refresh, C's AI commands and "which site is this tab" answer only Aegis One's own pages; cookie choices only Aegis One's scripts; content/cookie-detector.js sends `cookieChoice` instead of writing aegisData.
5. **"Do not sell or share" click has no switch** (`content/cookie-detector.js`, Matthew's file). Add one under Settings › C on websites, then update PRIVACY.md, TERMS.md and the welcome page.
6. **Wording**: the dashboard footer says Aegis One "only downloads public lists (trackers, ...)". Trackers are bundled, not downloaded, and policy pages are also fetched; align it with PRIVACY.md. **Done:** the dashboard note now says the tracker list is built in and policy pages are fetched without cookies.
After any of these, re-read PRIVACY.md, TERMS.md and welcome/welcome.html, and run `node --test`.
