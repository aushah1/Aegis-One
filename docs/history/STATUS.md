> **History.** The team's status board and decision log during the hackathon (Fri Oct 23 to Sat Oct 24). The rows show who was doing what at the time; the decision log is still the record of why the rules are what they are. The current state is in [../PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).

## Decisions (write the date and who decided)
- 2026-10-23: Gemma runs through Ollama on the demo Mac for now; in-browser Transformers.js is a stretch goal.
- 2026-10-23: Skip Globus raw RegTrack data; use facts from the RegTrack paper with page numbers (PLAN step 12).
- 2026-10-23: Cookie banners handled by JavaScript, not Gemma (Max's partner; Max's plan chat).
- 2026-10-23 (repo owner): scoring v3: only observed or on-record things add points; unknown = 0 but shown as "not checked yet". No-Reject banner 10, recent breach 15, older breach 5.
- 2026-10-23 (repo owner): no banner while the site tracks you = 10 ("you were never asked").
- 2026-10-23: download whole public lists (HIBP, CA registry) daily; never look up single sites. Store names only, 7-day history.
- 2026-10-24: keep the exposure score (higher = more exposed) as in IDEA.md; drop the "100 - exposure" Privacy Score from plan v2.
- 2026-10-24: long-term update server is out of scope for the hackathon.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): wait on in-browser Gemma until the kinks are out; Ollama stays for the demo (recorded on the repo owner's Mac).
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): 1260H and foreign-adversary country never double count (one 15-point line). A site owned by a company in a listed country counts as that line too.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): video presenters Matthew, Max and Justin; recorded on the repo owner's Mac.
- 2026-10-24: hold max/mascot-poses until Matthew finishes; old ask-c branch deleted (superseded by max-askc).
- 2026-10-24 1:30 AM: merged Max's R3 policy reader (89 tests). Found state-run sites in listed countries aren't flagged; fix plan F1-F5 in PLAN.md and HANDOFF.md.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): F1 rule confirmed (country web address = one 15-point line; unknown outside servers with those endings = label only). F3: download registry lists through Chrome.
- 2026-10-24 (Claude, asked by repo owner): F3 site's own server registered in a listed country = the 15-point line; outside servers = label only.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): breach rule v4: last 12 months 15, last 5 years 5, older 0 unless 100 million+ accounts (5); all breaches listed.
- 2026-10-24: google.com got B from Google's result-page prefetch (an AliExpress ad page counted as an Alibaba tracker). Fixed: page loads (main_frame) never count as trackers.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): keep daily totals (numbers only, no site names) for 90 days for the impact and safety views; count every C pop-up. Site history stays 7 days.
- 2026-10-24: merged Matthew's latest c-prompt.js and cookie-detector.js unchanged (from his aegis-ui folder); content/c-events.js counts C's pop-ups/clicks and reports cookie choices.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): option 1: keep a site's 7-day combined record and label it "Seen on your visits in the last 7 days" (not "this visit").
- 2026-10-24: fixed google.com B (Google result prefetch reported as "other") and the popup showing sample data after a reload.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): the in-browser AI version becomes the main download; the Ollama-only version moves to its own branch. Done the same day (repo owner approved): main = in-browser, branch `ollama` = Ollama only.
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): a settings button or "Choose cookies" isn't a one-click Reject, so C still says "Beware!" there (Trainline, Argos).
- 2026-10-24 (repo owner): "Protect me" replaces "Decline extras"; new "Protect me automatically" setting (off by default). Ask C: steps only when asked, stays on privacy, remembers the last 3 questions.
- 2026-10-24: merged main into ui-glass (speed work); cookie-detector fixes 1-6 + Tesco slide-away decline; dashboard About tab for judges.
