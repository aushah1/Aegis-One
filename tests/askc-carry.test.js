// Ask Aegis keeps the topic across short follow-ups (Max, real Gemma on the Mac, 2026-10-25): after "Was google hacked?"
// and "What about quest diagnostics?", "What about puffco?" went to Gemma, because Aegis only looked one question back and
// that one had no breach word. "Was google hacked?" was also answered about docs.google.com (a site he visited)
// instead of Google. Now "what about X?" takes the last real question from the last 3 (skipping other "what about"s)
// and asks it about X, so the same database lookups answer it. Run with: node --test
