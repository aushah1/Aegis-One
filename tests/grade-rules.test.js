// Justin's two reports (docs/IDEA.md on New-Grading_Scale, 2026-10-24):
// 1. Asking Aegis why a site's "tracker connections" line cost points got "I don't know yet": the rules behind each line
//    weren't in Aegis's evidence. Each line of the score now carries its rule, and Aegis answers from it.
// 2. Quest Diagnostics had a breach in the news but Aegis One said "No known data breaches". Have I Been Pwned only lists
//    breaches whose account data became public; the line now says where it looked, and its rule says that.
// Run with: node --test
