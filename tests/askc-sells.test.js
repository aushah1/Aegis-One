// "Does wired.com sell my data?" (G14 real-Gemma run, Oct 25, Q3): Gemma answered "Yes, wired.com has a privacy policy that
// says they sell personal information [Privacy policy]", but Aegis One had never read wired.com's policy. A question about
// whether a site you visited sells or shares your data is now answered instantly from the site's own policy record:
// its quoted sentence when Aegis One read one, a plain "I don't know yet" when it didn't, plus what was seen on your visit
// (advertising companies and registered data brokers), without claiming a tracker proves a sale (docs/SPEC.md Honesty rules).
// Run with: node --test
