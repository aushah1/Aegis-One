// PLAN R19l/m/n (Preston, 2026-10-25, real Gemma): Aegis couldn't say which sites the dashboard's "Recording your screen" and
// "Labelled malware" trackers came from, gave different answers to "which sites I visited had recent data breaches?" (one
// wording was answered about a breach named "Recent" on a site never visited), and answered "How safe are you Aegis One?"
// like a chatbot ("it helps you block trackers": Aegis One doesn't block anything). Questions asking where a dashboard item
// came from are answered from the records, naming every match and what was checked and didn't match; questions about
// Aegis One itself get Aegis One's own answers. Run with: node --test
